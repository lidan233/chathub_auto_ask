Project Overview
---------------

This project is designed to interact with the Chathub platform using Selenium and Python. The script logs in to the platform using Google authentication, sends problems to the chat interface, and extracts the outputs. The project also includes a feature to extract titles from JSON files and save the outputs to text files.

### Features

*   Google authentication using Selenium
*   Sending problems to the Chathub interface
*   Extracting outputs from the chat interface
*   Extracting titles from JSON files
*   Saving outputs to text files

### Requirements

*   Python 3.8+
*   Selenium
*   Undetected Chromedriver
*   Python JSON library

### Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium undetected_chromedriver json
```

### Usage

To run the script, simply execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will start the Selenium browser, log in to the Chathub platform, send problems, extract outputs, and save them to text files.

### JSON File Format

The JSON files used for extracting titles should have the following format:

```json
[
    {
        "title": "Title 1"
    },
    {
        "title": "Title 2"
    },
    {
        "title": "Title 3"
    }
]
```

### Configuration

The script uses the following configuration:

*   `iclr2021.json` file: This file contains the titles to be extracted. The script starts from the 1200th title.
*   `outputs` directory: This directory is used to save the output text files.
*   `inputs` directory: This directory contains the JSON files used for extracting titles.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the script, make sure to:

*   Check the Chrome browser version and update it if necessary
*   Ensure that the Chromedriver version is compatible with the Chrome browser version
*   Verify that the JSON files are in the correct format and directory
