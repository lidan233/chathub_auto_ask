From the provided titles, these are specifically related to single-view 3D reconstruction or generation:

Director3D: Real-world Camera Trajectory and 3D Scene Generation from Text
X-Ray: A Sequential 3D Representation For Generation

These papers appear to focus on 3D generation from single inputs (text in Director3D's case, and sequential representation in X-Ray's case).

Note: While there are other papers related to 3D topics (like 3D point clouds, multi-view 3D, etc.), I only included those specifically focused on single-view 3D reconstruction or generation aspects.
