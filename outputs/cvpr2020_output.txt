Based on my analysis, here are the titles specifically related to single-view 3D reconstruction or generation:

"Novel View Synthesis of Dynamic Scenes With Globally Coherent Depths From a Monocular Camera"
"Robust 3D Self-Portraits in Seconds"
"Object-Occluded Human Shape and Pose Estimation From a Single Color Image"
"PIFuHD: Multi-Level Pixel-Aligned Implicit Function for High-Resolution 3D Human Digitization"
"Self-Supervised Human Depth Estimation From Monocular Videos"

These papers focus on reconstructing or generating 3D content from single-view/monocular inputs.
