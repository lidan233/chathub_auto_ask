Based on my analysis, here are the titles specifically related to single-view 3D reconstruction or generation:

"3DCaricShop: A Dataset and a Baseline Method for Single-View 3D Caricature Face Reconstruction"

"Body2Hands: Learning To Infer 3D Hands From Conversational Gesture Body Dynamics"

"Cuboids Revisited: Learning Robust 3D Shape Fitting to Single RGB Images"

"D2IM-Net: Learning Detail Disentangled Implicit Fields From Single Images"

These titles specifically mention single-view or single-image 3D reconstruction/generation tasks. While there are many other papers dealing with 3D topics, these are the ones that explicitly focus on reconstruction or generation from a single view/image.
