PSHead: 3D Head Reconstruction from a Single Image with Diffusion Prior and Self-Enhancement

Note that while there are several other papers related to 3D topics (like Gaussian Splatting, multi-view reconstruction, etc.), these don't specifically focus on single-view 3D reconstruction/generation. The only paper that explicitly addresses single-view 3D reconstruction is PSHead.
