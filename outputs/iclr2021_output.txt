After analyzing all titles, I don't find any titles that are directly focused on single-view 3D reconstruction or generation. While there are a few papers that deal with 3D topics (like "Concentric Spherical GNN for 3D Representation Learning" and "3D Scene Compression through Entropy Penalized Neural Representation Functions"), they are focused on different aspects like representation learning and compression rather than single-view 3D reconstruction or generation.
