Based on my analysis, here are the titles specifically related to single-view 3D reconstruction or generation:

"Automatic Generation of a 3D Braid Hair Model From a Single Image"
"Interactive Editing of Monocular Depth"
"Neural 3D Reconstruction in the Wild"
"Single-view View Synthesis in the Wild With Learned Adaptive Multiplane Images"
"Symmetry-driven 3D Reconstruction From Concept Sketches"

These papers specifically deal with reconstructing or generating 3D content from single-view inputs (single images, monocular views, or single sketches).
After analyzing these titles, none of them are
